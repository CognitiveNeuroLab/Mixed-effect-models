2. [Statistics (including mixed-effects models)](#statistics-including-mixed-effects-models)





## Loading and setting up the structure
The Script imports data from a .txt file, it creates factors and it randomly selects 200 trials per subject (so everyone has equal amounts of data)


## Statistics (including mixed-effects models)
First it creates a summary of the data, which includes mean and standard deviation. After that it plots the data in a violin/box plot.

You can design your mixed-effects model and, after that, create a summary with the results of your model computation.
